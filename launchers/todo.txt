#### Known problems
* PointEnv plotting broken on MacOS
* gym-sawyer task space control broken

# Install problems
  * baselines install seems broken with pipenv
  * mujoco_py install broken -- numpy versions mismatch
	  - workaround:
	    ```sh
	    pipenv run pip uninstall mujoco_py
	    pipenv run pip install mujoco_py
	    ```
# Packaging problems
 * garage: data directory is in site-packages
  * garage: scripts/run_experiment.py not copied during setup
	  - workaround:
	    ```sh
	    mkdir -p <missing dir from error>
	    cp external/garage/scripts/run_experiment.py <missing dir from error>
	    ```
* multiworld assets not copied during setup.py (make PR)
  - workaround: same as garage/scripts
* gym-sawyer vendor files files not copied by setup.py
  - workaround: same as garage/scripts
